## General Info
**Purpose**: As with most projects, it is meant to fix a problem of mine, in this case creating videos without much of a hassle. And welp I guess there are some chances someone else might have the same problem. So here you go someone, go and become famous.

**Inspiration**: As with [RSS Feeder](https://github.com/Ckrielle/RSS-Feeder), [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeSmithxyz) inspired me once again. He wrote a script which takes images and audio and makes a video with them. That video is also the inspiration behind the formatting of the files.txt file. So I decided to write my own version with python and add a bit more to it.

**Naming**: From Doofenshmirtz. The thing is that the word stems from famine, and not fame, but let's agree otherwise.

## Installation

All you have to do is copy paste the commands below into your terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/Ckrielle/Faminator.git
cd Faminator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To-Do & Bugs

Truth be told I'm of the Luke Smith school of video making. That means no editing. So the program works fine for what I want, though more could be added:
* When you create a video and put audio over it, the video takes the length of the audio file. I finally understood what "it's not a bug, it's a feature" means.
* Give the possibility to 2x a clip/video or a portion of it.
* Provide more editing features.
* Help in generating files.txt.
And whatever else comes to my mind at a later time.
